/**
 * Indicates that an property, collection or action is to be called
 * programmatically and should be ignored from the metamodel.
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, it may be a helper method that needs to be <tt>public</tt> but
 * that doesn't conform to the requirements of an action (for example, invalid
 * parameter types).
 * 
 * <p>
 * It can also be added to a type, meaning that the type is ignored from the metamodel.
 * This is intended as a &quot;get out of jail&quot; for any classes from unit tests, say,
 * that end up on the classpath of integration tests but should otherwise be ignored.
 *
 * <p>
 * This is intended as a replacement for {@link Ignore} (the use of which is
 * being discouraged because of the name clash with <tt>org.junit.Ignore</tt>).
