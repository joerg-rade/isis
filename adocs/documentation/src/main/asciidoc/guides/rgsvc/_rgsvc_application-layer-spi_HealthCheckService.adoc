This service, if implemented, is used to performs a health check to determine if the application is still available.
The results of this service are made available through a REST resource, typically mounted at `/restful/health`.

The service, when called, will be within the context of a special internal user `__health` with the internal role `__health-role`.

This service was introduced to allow deployment infrastructure to monitor the app and (potentially) restart it if required.
For example, if deploying to Docker then both Docker Swarm and Kubernetes are orchestrators that can perform this task.


== SPI & Implementation

The SPI defined by `HealthCheckService` is:

[source,java]
----
public interface HealthCheckService {
    @Programmatic
    public Health check();
}
----

There is no default implementation.
Any custom implementations should be annotated using `@DomainService(nature = NatureOfService.DOMAIN)`.


== REST API Mapping

The `/restful/health` path must be specified as a "passThru" so that no authentication challenge is issued.

[source,xml]
.web.xml
----
<filter>
    <filter-name>IsisSessionFilterForRestfulObjects</filter-name>
    <filter-class>org.apache.isis.core.webapp.IsisSessionFilter</filter-class>
    ...
    <init-param>
        <param-name>passThru</param-name>
        <param-value>/restful/swagger,/restful/health</param-value>
    </init-param>
    ...
</filter>
----

This is a comma separated list, so there may be other values also (for example `/restful/swagger`, as shown above).
