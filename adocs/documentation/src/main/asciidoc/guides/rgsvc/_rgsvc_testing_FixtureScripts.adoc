The `FixtureScripts` service provides the ability to execute xref:../ugtst/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_fixture-scripts_api-and-usage[fixture scripts].

The default implementation of this service, `FixtureScriptsDefault`, uses the associated xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_testing_FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider[`FixtureScriptsSpecificationProvider`] to obtain a `FixtureScriptsSpecification`.
This configures this service, for example telling it which package to search for `FixtureScript` classes, how to execute those classes, and hints that influence the UI.

        String parameters) { ... }
}
