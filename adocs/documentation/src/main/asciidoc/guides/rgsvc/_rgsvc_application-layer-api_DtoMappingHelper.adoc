The `DtoMappingHelper` converts the domain object's internal identifier into a serializable `OidDto` for use in the xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-cmd[command] and xref:../rgcms/rgcms.adoc#_rgcms_schema-ixn[interaction] schemas.

[source,java]
----
public class DtoMappingHelper {

    public OidDto oidDtoFor(final Object object) { ... }    // <1>
}
----
<1> Uses the xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_integration-api_BookmarkService[`BookmarkService`] to convert the domain object's internal identifier into a serializable `OidDto`.
