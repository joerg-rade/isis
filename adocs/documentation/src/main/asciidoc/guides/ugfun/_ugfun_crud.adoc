This chapter shows the idioms for creating, reading, updating and deleting xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_domain-entities[domain entities].

It also shows how to instantiate xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_view-models[view models] and how to programmatically instantiate xref:../ugfun/ugfun.adoc#_ugfun_building-blocks_types-of-domain-objects_mixins[mixins] (useful primarily for xref:../ugtst/ugtst.adoc#_ugtst_integ-test-support[integration testing]).

[NOTE]
====
The main domain services used are xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_persistence-layer-api_RepositoryService[`RepositoryService`] and xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_FactoryService[`FactoryService`].
These (and some other services) replace the now deprecated xref:../rgsvc/rgsvc.adoc#_rgsvc_core-domain-api_DomainObjectContainer[`DomainObjectContainer`].
