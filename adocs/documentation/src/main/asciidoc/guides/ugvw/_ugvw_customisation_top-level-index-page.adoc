If the user visits the root of the webapp (eg http://localhost:8080[]), then a top-level index page can specified.
This is a static file that typically has hyperlinks to the available resources available (eg the Wicket viewer at `/wicket/`, the Swagger UI is bound to `/swagger-ui`, the Restful at `/restful/`).

The archetypes provide an example in the `about/index.html` file (relative to `src/main/webapp`).
This is configured using the `web.xml`:


.web.xml
[source,xml]
----
<welcome-file-list>
    <welcome-file>about/index.html</welcome-file>
</welcome-file-list>
----

If instead you want to redirect users directly to the Wicket viewer, then this file should contain simply:

.about/index.html
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head>
    <META HTTP-EQUIV="Refresh" CONTENT="0; URL=wicket/"/>
</head>
</html>
----
