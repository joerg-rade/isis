By default the Wicket viewer will display the application name top-left in the header menu.
This can be changed to display a png logo instead.

== Screenshots

The screenshot below shows the Isis addons example https://github.com/isisaddons/isis-app-todoapp/[todoapp] (not ASF) with a 'brand logo' image in its header:

image::{_imagesdir}brand-logo/brand-logo.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}brand-logo/brand-logo.png"]

A custom brand logo (typically larger) can also be specified for the signin page:

image::{_imagesdir}brand-logo/brand-logo-signin.png[width="750px",link="{_imagesdir}brand-logo/brand-logo-signin.png"]



To configure, simply specify the appropriate configuration properties:

[source,properties]
----
isis.wicket.viewer.application.brandLogoSignin=/images/todoapp-logo-signin.png
isis.wicket.viewer.application.brandLogoHeader=/images/todoapp-logo-header.png
----

These are resolved relative to `src/main/webapp`, or an absolute URL can be specified.

* for the signin image, a size of 400x100 works well.
* for the header image, a size of 160x40 works well.


You may also wish to tweak the xref:../rgcfg/rgcfg.adoc#_rgcfg_application-specific_application-css[`application.css`].
For example, a logo with height 40px works well with the following:

[source,css]
----
.navbar-brand img {
    margin-top: -5px;
    margin-left: 5px;
}
