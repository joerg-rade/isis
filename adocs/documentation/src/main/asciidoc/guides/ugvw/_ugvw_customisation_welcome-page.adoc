It's possible to customize the application name, welcome message (as displayed on the home page if not home page service is configured) and the about message can all be customized.
This is done by specifying the appropriate configuration properties:

[source,properties]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.application.name=My Wonderful App
isis.viewer.wicket.welcome.file=welcome.html
isis.viewer.wicket.application.about=My Wonderful App v1.0
----
<1> the `welcome.html` file is resolved relative to `src/main/webapp`.

[TIP]
====
Do not confuse the welcome page file with the xref:ugvw.adoc#_ugvw_customisation_top-level-index-page[top-level index page]; they are different things!
====


The `application.name` is used both on the sign-in page and also top-left on the header.
It's also possible to replace this text with images:


[source,properties]
----
isis.viewer.wicket.application.brandLogoSignin=/images/logo-512.png
isis.viewer.wicket.application.brandLogoHeader=/images/logo-80x32.png
----

These images are resolved relative to `src/main/webapp`.
