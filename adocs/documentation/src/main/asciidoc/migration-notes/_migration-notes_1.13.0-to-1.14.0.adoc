== New metamodel validations

This release defines a number of metamodel validations.
These can be enabled or disabled using configuration properties:

* `isis.reflector.validator.explicitObjectType` +
+
Whether to check that the class has an object type explicitly specified somehow.
This is strongly recommended, but is disabled by default to prevent migration issues.

* `isis.reflector.validator.jdoqlFromClause` +
+
Whether to check that the class name in JDOQL `FROM` clause matches or is a supertype of the class on which it is annotated.
This is enabled by default.

* `isis.reflector.validator.jdoqlVariablesClause` +
+
Whether to check that the class name in JDOQL `VARIABLES` clause is a recognized class.
This is enabled by default.

* `isis.reflector.validator.mixinsOnly` +
+
This is disabled by default; if enabled, this configuration property will treat any contributed service as invalid; instead use mixins (as a simpler/less confusing programming model).

* `isis.reflector.validator.noParamsOnly` +
+
When searching for  link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.14.0/guides/rgcms/rgcms.html#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_disable[`disableXxx()`] or link:https://isis.apache.org/versions/1.14.0/guides/rgcms/rgcms.html#_rgcms_methods_prefixes_hide[`hideXxx()`] supporting methods, whether to search only for the no-param version (or also for supporting methods that match the parameter types of the action). +
+
This is disabled by default; if enabled then this makes for a simpler programming model.

* `isis.reflector.validator.serviceActionsOnly` +
+
Domain services are stateless (at least conceptually) and so should not have any properties or collections; any that are defined will not be rendered by the viewers. +
+
This is disabled by default; if enabled, then this ensure that domain services only declare actions and so makes for a simpler programming model.
